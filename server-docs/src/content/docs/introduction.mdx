description: Learn what you can build with the Hytale Server Plugin API
---

The Hytale Server Plugin API lets you create custom game modes, events, and server functionality using Kotlin (or Java).

## What You Can Build

- **Game modes** - PvP arenas, survival variants, mini-games, RTS games
- **Custom commands** - Admin tools, teleportation, player management
- **Economy systems** - Shops, trading, currencies
- **Event listeners** - React to player actions, world changes, combat
- **Scheduled tasks** - Timers, countdowns, periodic events
- **Custom entities** - NPCs, mobs with custom behavior
- **World manipulation** - Build systems, terrain modification

## Prerequisites

- **Kotlin** (or Java) - Examples use Kotlin
- **Gradle** - Build tool for compiling plugins
- **Java 25** - Required runtime version
- **Hytale Server** - Download from Hytale

## Architecture Overview

The server uses an **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture:

- **Entities** - Players, mobs, items are entities (just IDs)
- **Components** - Data attached to entities (position, health, inventory)
- **Systems** - Process entities with specific components each tick

Key concepts:
- Each **World** runs on a dedicated thread
- **Events** are dispatched to registered listeners
- **Commands** are registered through `CommandRegistry`
- **Tasks** can be scheduled for delayed or repeated execution

### ECS Deep Dive

Understanding ECS is critical for Hytale plugin development:

- **Store** - Central database holding all entities and components
- **Holder** - Blueprint for entity creation (configure before spawn)
- **Ref** - Safe pointer to an entity (validated references)
- **CommandBuffer** - Queue modifications for thread-safe execution
- **Query** - Filter entities by component composition

See [ECS Theory](/ecs-theory) for a complete guide to the architecture.
